						<p class="lead light-green-text text-darken-2">Save Your Car from Any Trouble on the Road</p>
						
						<p class="">Every driver wants his car to function as long as possible. However, there are some factors that may come in the way of trouble-free usage of your car. To eliminate them, car dealerships and manufacturers offer their customers various car warranty programs. AutoTraider is no exception. We provide our clients with extended warranty programs for both new and used vehicles.</p>
						
						<p class="">Even if your car is already warranted by the manufacturer, we can extend its warranty period and make sure it will receive proper coverage and maintenance as a part of the following programs:</p>
						
						<ul class="services-ul">
						  <li>New Vehicle Warranty Program;</li>
						  <li>Premium Warranty Program;</li>
						  <li>Used Vehicle Warranty Program;</li>
						  <li>Roadside Assistance Program;</li>
						  <li>Car Care Warranty Program.</li>
